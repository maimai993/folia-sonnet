// src/services/analysis/drumHits.ts
// A whole track's drum hits, read off htdemucs' drum stem (drumStem.ts, the renderer's GPU) and kept:
// in memory, on disk under the track's analysis key (DRUM_HITS_PREFIX, registered with the beat lists
// in services/repositories/cacheRepository.ts as analysis data), and in flight for as long as one run
// is going - the layering of beatGrid.ts. 时计 plays them under 智能动感模式
// (components/visualizer/pendolo/usePendoloBeatFx.ts): the user found the drums' own hits far truer
// than any rule over beat_this' beats (2026-10-17).
//
// The hits themselves, and the drumless guard, are worked out in drumHitPicking.ts.
//
// GPU only, and only with htdemucs_gpu installed (`canRunDrumStem`): without them there are no hits,
// and 时计 plays beat_this' beats as it always did. A separation takes ~15 s of GPU for a four-minute
// track, so it runs only for the wanted track (`setWantedDrumTrack`) and stops at its next segment
// once another is wanted - skipping through tracks does not queue their separations up. The wanted
// track is the one 智能动感模式 plays while it is on (hooks/useBeatFxTrack.ts), not only while 时计 is
// on screen: a separation stopped on a picture switch threw away what it had, and coming back to 时计
// separated the track again from the start. Under 智能动感模式's `cached` nothing separates: only a
// stored analysis is read (`loadStoredDrumHits`), and switching to it stops a separation as leaving the
// track does - its hits so far go with it (the `finally` in loadTrackDrumHits).
// (From the PR #750 review: the two sentences above on a picture switch are PR #734's; since the
// analysis service's 2b a picture switch stops the separation again, and it keeps where it was and
// the hits so far (DrumResume) to carry on from - see the note at the end of hooks/useBeatFxTrack.ts.)
//
// A track separating now has hits before it is done: the stem is read as its head is finished
// (drumHitStream.ts), and about once a second (LIVE_EVERY_MS) the hits so far are picked again and
// handed over with `until`, the time they reach. Picked again, not appended: a band's loud hits
// (HIT_TOP), which every strength is a share of, are known only over what has been heard, so each
// pick rescales what came before - online softmax's running normaliser, and the hits ahead of the
// playhead are the better for it. The drumless guard is the same, over the head so far, and only
// from LIVE_MIN_SECONDS of it: before that, 时计 plays the beats. Separation runs far ahead of
// playback (some 15x on an M-series GPU), so the hits are there in about a second, and the stored
// analysis is the last pick - the whole track's.

// What callers have always imported from here.

 * 为什么必须换一条路（真机实测的结论，不是猜的）：
 *   · htdemucs 一段 3.9 秒的音频，桌面 8 核 CPU 上 0.85 秒；手机上（2 线程、大核更少）
 *     要 4～8 秒。一首四分钟的歌 60 多段，合计 4～8 分钟；
 *   · 而分离是**边播边分**的：播放头 3.9 秒走完一段，分离却要 4～8 秒才出一段，
 *     于是 `until`（已分到的时间）永远落在播放头后面，`getDrumHits` 里没有一个
 *     落在"当前时间"上的 hit —— 仿真鼓面一动不动。用户看到的就是「时计没效果」。
 *
 * 混音上直接取频带没有这个问题：整曲解码一次（不到一秒），每 10 秒做一次 mel
 * （worker 里，几十到几百毫秒），第一个 10 秒的 hits 半秒内就到手，全程快于播放。
 *
 * 代价是准确度：混音的低频带里有贝斯，中频带里有人声和钢琴，高频带里有镲和齿音 ——
 * 这些起音都会被记成 kick / snare / hat。鼓面因此比真分轨"忙"一些，但**跟着音乐动**，
 * 而且桌面（真 htdemucs_gpu）的行为一点没变：这条只在安卓生效，缓存在独立的前缀下。
 *
 * 桌面那条路（`drumHitsTask` + `runTrackStems`）原样保留。
